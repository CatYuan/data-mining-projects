# Data Mining Methods

This project implements several different data mining methods.

## Pattern Mining

- [Apriori algorithm - to mine frequent patterns](./1-Pattern%20Mining/mp1-mining%20freq%20itemsets/)
- [contiguous sequential pattern mining algorithm](./1-Pattern%20Mining/mp2-seq%20pattern%20mining/)

## Cluster Analysis

- [K Means](./2-Cluster%20Analysis/mp1-kmeans/)
- [Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering](./2-Cluster%20Analysis//mp2-AGNES/)
- [Clustering Validation Measures](./2-Cluster%20Analysis/mp3-validation/)

## Classification

- [Decision Tree Classifier](./3-Classification/mp1-decision-tree/)
- [Naive Bayes Classifier](./3-Classification/mp2-naive-bayes/)
